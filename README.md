##  Project  — *Freelance MarketPlace*

**Freelance MarketPlace** — it’s a full-stack web application that connects job posters and freelancers in one digital platform.

The main goal of this project was to create a reliable and user-friendly freelance system where users can **add, update, delete, and accept jobs or tasks** with full authentication and database support.


###  Project Concept

I built this project to demonstrate my full-stack skills using the **MERN stack** — that means:

* **Frontend:** React.js
* **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
* **Authentication:** Firebase (Email/Password and Google Login)

The entire app is responsive and works smoothly across **mobile, tablet, and desktop** devices.

###  Key Features

Here are some of the major features I implemented:

2. **CRUD Operations:** Users can add, edit, and delete their own job posts.
3. **Dynamic Job System:** All jobs are fetched from MongoDB Atlas and displayed dynamically.
4. **Accept Job Feature:** Logged-in users can accept jobs posted by *others* (not their own).
5. **Dark/Light Theme Toggle:** Users can switch themes
6. **Responsive UI:** Every page is optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
7. **Custom 404 Page and Loading Spinner** for better user experience.
